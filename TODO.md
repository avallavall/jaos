# TODO — the current milestone

Rows from `SPECS.md`. A line leaves this file in the commit that lands it.
When the file is empty, pick the next rows from SPECS and fill it again.

    cycle between the ratio test's pivot floor and `LU_AGREE_TOL`. Fix so the
    warm attempt answers without the cold retry.
