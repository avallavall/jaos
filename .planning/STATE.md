# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-12)

**Core value:** A correct answer, bit-identical on every machine and every run, proved by a checker that had no access to the solver that produced it.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — candidate-admission-in-the-ratio-test
**Milestone:** M2 — LP competitiveness

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (candidate-admission-in-the-ratio-test) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-08-12 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

`DECISIONS.md` at the repository root is the authority — D1 through D92, all
locked, each carrying the measurement that closed it. PROJECT.md's
`<decisions>` block carries the IDs that constrain this milestone; it does not
replace the file.

Roadmap-level decisions taken at milestone opening:

- Milestone 1 of this roadmap is the project's **M2 — LP competitiveness**
- **Candidate admission before presolve** (WARNING 1) — D81 measured presolve at
  1.417x/1.136x against a per-iteration gap of 2.53x, and says that reorders
  the plan

- **The candidate-admission decision is the first deliverable, before any code**
  — PLAN.md item 3a says so outright

- **The re-entry oscillation is roadmap work** (WARNING 2), not an accepted
  limitation, despite a measured cost of 0.24% on `pilot87` and no cure named

- **The M2 per-instance guard factor stays absent until measured** (WARNING 3)
  — no number is invented anywhere in these artifacts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **[Phase 5] No controlled host is named.** D17 says a WSL number cannot close
  a gate, and the machine that builds and measures JAOS is a Windows host
  running WSL. Phase 5 cannot produce its closing number without one. Phases 1–4
  are unaffected.

- **[Phase 5] The M2 guard factor is unset** and must be measured or explicitly
  dropped from the criterion. It is not to be guessed.

- **[Phase 2 → Phase 5] T0 is "the simplex and only the simplex."** Presolve
  contributes nothing to the close criterion as stated; how the ladder is
  recalibrated once JAOS has a presolve is undecided in the source.

- **[All phases] Five of seven v1 requirements carry no acceptance criterion.**
  That is `PLAN.md`'s own state, not an extraction gap. Deriving each is
  plan-phase work.

- **[All phases] The gate cannot see the defect class that produced three of
  last milestone's four closures** — those came from sweeping `REFACTOR_EVERY`
  over 16..256, which no target automates. `make clean` between settings or the
  sweep measures one binary N times.
